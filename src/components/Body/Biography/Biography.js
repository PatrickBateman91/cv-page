                        I have been coding for a little over 3 years now, mostly for myself. My background is in film. I have studied directing at Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo, and have worked as an assistant director in feature-length movies, shorts and commercials. <span className="highlighted">But my heart is in code.</span> What started as a sunday hobby became a passion and obsession. And now I am looking to switch career path, permanently.

                        I love challenges. I would describe myself as being very logical and methodical, good at problem solving and a team player. I have a huge desire to learn new things, and I am very well aware that my current coding knowledge has gaps and I am eager to fill them with the guidance of seniors and other professionals.

                    <div className="biography-paragraph">
                        I have always been described as a professional above all. I am punctual and neat, both in personal life and in work environment. I fit great into hierarchy. I can take charge when needed and recognize when itâ€™s time to lay back and let others lead. If you are sceptical about my level of expertise, I understand that completely. What I suggest is that you browse through my showcase projects. Create a profile, add bets and groups and then delete them. Buy a pair of shoes and check the stats and availability.  Try to crash the websites. Try to access confidental data via postman or some other way. Point being, <span className="highlighted">Give me chance. You might not regret it.</span>
