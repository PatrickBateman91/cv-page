            I have been coding for about 4 years now, mostly for myself. My
            background is in film. I have studied directing at the Academy of
            Performing Arts in Sarajevo, and have worked as an assistant
            director in feature-length movies, shorts and commercials.{" "}
            <span className="highlighted">But my heart is in code.</span> What
            started as a Sunday hobby became a passion and obsession. In April
            2021, I officially started my dev journey and I'm not looking back.

            I love challenges. I would describe myself as being very logical and
            methodical, good at problem-solving, and a team player. I have a huge
            desire to learn new things, and I am very well aware that my current
            coding knowledge has gaps and I am eager to fill them with the
            guidance of seniors and other professionals.

          <div className="biography-paragraph">
            I have always been described as a professional above all. I am
            punctual and neat, both in my personal life and in a work environment. I
            fit great into the hierarchy. I can take charge when needed and
            recognize when itâ€™s time to lay back and let others lead.
