Users can create groups for each circle of friends or family, and keep track of bets and balance in each of them cleanly and separately. Everything functions on a mutual acceptance system. They can propose, accept, decline, edit and finish bets themselves. There is a notification system in place that helps users keep track of all the changes happening in their ecosystem.",

This shop is 100% user reliant, so it’s a fair game for every manufacturer, big or small. Sometimes it’s cruel, sometimes it’s rewarding and the only thing that matters in the end is how users liked your product.",

They can rate every item in a shop, add them to favourites, or put in cart to hold for future. Every purchase is tracked on both user’s account and in the admin dashboard, which gives admin opportunity to keep track of shop statistics by year/month/brand/gender, to add or remove discounts, send newsletters, respond to user inquiries, add items and edit existing, whether it is to restock or rebrand the product.",
